## Overview
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates

Between Steve and Bryce

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - Steve is available whenever, and will be open to recieve messages via slack or discord. We will get back to others when possible.

  - Discord/Slack/phone
- How often will you take breaks?
  - As needed
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - We will just talk to each other, get work done as needed.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Steve: Strong in CSS and design web layout, graphic design, research, teamwork, work overtime, and dedication.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - We are strong in different areas, we should have a solid lay out of what needs to happen, and how to tackle each individual situation.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Steve: I want to develop better JS apps.
  
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - open line of communication.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - We will talk to each other like adults and figure it out.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - We can talk to each other, if that fails, we can get sara involved.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We will have code reviews before working.
